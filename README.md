## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![lm_output](https://github.com/Zainab1979/MechaCarChallenge.RScript/blob/5cc969457f114869f7732ced37d2c67e9e5babf4/lm_output.png) 
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Intercept,vehicle leangth and grand_clearnce
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No its not Zero as we can see in the image.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes because P value is very small.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The screenshoot shows the statistic (Mean Median Variance SD) of the PSI per each lot.

The screenshoot shows the statistic (Mean Median Variance SD) of PSI data in all lots.
##The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
The lot3 in the manufacturing lots is not meeting the qualification as it exceed the 100 pound by 70.
In total Variance 62.29356 and it meet the qualification
