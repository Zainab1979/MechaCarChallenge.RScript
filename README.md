![lm_output](https://github.com/Zainab1979/MechaCarChallenge.RScript/blob/5cc969457f114869f7732ced37d2c67e9e5babf4/lm_output.png) 
Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Intercept,vehicle leangth and grand_clearnce
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
No its not Zero as we can see in the image.
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
Yes because P value is very small.
